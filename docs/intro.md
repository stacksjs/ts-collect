# Introduction

> `ts-collect`, a powerful, fully-typed collections library for TypeScript, combining Laravel's collection elegance with advanced data processing capabilities. Features lazy evaluation, statistical analysis, machine learning operations, and comprehensive data manipulation toolsâ€”all with zero dependencies.

## Features

- Lightweight & Dependency-free
- Fully typed
- Laravel-inspired APIs
